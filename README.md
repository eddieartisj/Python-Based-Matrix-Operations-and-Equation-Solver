# Python-Based-Matrix-Operations-and-Equation-Solver
A Python-based implementation of fundamental matrix operations and a system of linear equations solver, built from scratch without external libraries to reinforce core concepts in linear algebra and machine learning foundations.

# Purpose

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning Foundations course as part of Purdue University's Cybersecurity Workforce Certification Training program. It demonstrates how to perform matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) and solve systems of linear equations using Python from scratch, without external libraries like NumPy.

This project deepened my understanding of:
- Core linear algebra operations
- Implementing algorithms without relying on prebuilt libraries
- Recursive methods for determinant calculation
- Solving real-world problems using fundamental Python skills

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Machine_Learning_Foundations_Lab_1_Assignment.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation and outputs.
- `README.md`: Overview and explanations of tasks.

## üîß Tasks Completed

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Matrix Addition
Implemented matrix addition by iterating through each element of the matrices and summing corresponding elements.

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Matrix Subtraction
Similar to Task 1, but subtracts elements of the second matrix from the first. Also added dimension checks for valid operations.

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Matrix Multiplication
Built matrix multiplication from scratch, checking that dimensions are compatible (i.e., columns in A == rows in B) before performing dot product logic.

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Solving a System of Linear Equations
Used:
- Matrix inverse calculation via cofactor and determinant method.
- Matrix multiplication to solve a 2-variable linear system using the formula: `x = A‚Åª¬π * b`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
